##Offline option 

Found in pac

This processes the data and creates the graph repository from scratch

It assumes data files exist in a wide variety of forms ranging from standard RF2 to specific exports such as those generated by suppliers

To create the baseline IM2 class content follow these instructions. This can be run from IDE following a build or from an executable.

To remove specific source files from the import if they cannot be found, comment out the various lines in the Import app referring to the graph name

### Prerequisites
1. GRAPH DB community or standard version
2. Open search or Elastic search repository
3. Java 11.
4. 16 gig RAM (jvm -Xmx 16 gig ideal)

2. If not already Install and configure a Graph DB im repository with literal index, context index bur NO inference.
3. If not already Install and configure Open Search with basic authentication
4. Take a copy of the GRAPH DB configuration Config.ttl file and place in any folder except the temporary data folder
5. Create a directory for the temporary import data. I should not contain anything else as it will be cleared at the end
