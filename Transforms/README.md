# Importing Source data

## Offline (Preload) option 

Found in Transforms module

This processes the data and creates the graph repository from scratch

It assumes data files exist in a wide variety of forms ranging from standard RF2 to specific exports such as those generated by suppliers

To create the baseline IM2 class content follow these instructions. This can be run from IDE following a build or from an executable.

To remove specific source files from the import if they cannot be found, comment out the various lines in the Import app referring to the graph name

### Prerequisites
1. GRAPH DB community or standard version
2. Open search or Elastic search repository
3. Java 11.
4. 16 gig RAM (jvm -Xmx 16 gig ideal)

### Instructions for blank bulk load
1. Place source files in the various folders under a single root folder.
2. If not already Install and configure a Graph DB im repository with literal index, context index bur NO inference.
3. If not already Install and configure Open Search with basic authentication
4. Take a copy of the GRAPH DB configuration Config.ttl file and place in the root of the import data folder
5. Create a directory for the temporary import data. I should not contain anything else as it will be cleared at the end
6. Configure the run time parameters  for the 'ImportApp' as follows:
7. Make sure graph DB is NOT running
8. Delete the {im} graph repository folder (or the bulk import will fail)
9. run imports.Preload. This will throw errors if the source files are not present e.g. the unzipped Snomed RF2

### Program arguments  
source={folder for importData}\
preload={folder containing the preload tool and the config.ttl}\
temp={folder to hold the temporary data}\
