This application is used to download/update/maintain the import data files from TRUD used by the Information Manager
transforms.
The application takes 2 parameters:-

The API key can be obtained from the TRUD website (after logging in). The work folder should point to the TRUD subfolder
of your ImportData folder, e.g. `Z:\ImportData\TRUD\`
